# phpconsoleX
This extra integrates [phpconsole](http://phpconsole.com/) into the (MODX)[http://modx.com/] CMS. You will see all `$modx->log()` calls in phpconsole instead of the default error log. You can also use `$modx->phpconsole->send($anything)` to send any data to phpconsole. You can even log XPDOObjects with phpconsoleX, since they are automatically converted to an array.


## Configuration
You can either use the system setting `phpconsolex.config` for the configuration of phpconsole or you can save your configuration into a `phpconsole-config.inc.php` file into your MODX config folder. For more information about the configuration please follow the phpconsole docs: https://github.com/phpconsole/phpconsole/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md

## Installation
You can install phpconsoleX via the MODX Package Manager. Make sure to update the configuration after the installation â€“ you need to add your api key!
